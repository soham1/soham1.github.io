In reality, this website uses Angular 2, Material Design Lite, and Webpacks. Angular 2 is used to fetch all my information from JSON files and to display them without\\r\\n        refreshing the page. Webpacks is used to bundle my application and to make load times quicker. Lastly, Material Design Lite was used to make an eye-appealing UI.\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\\"demo-card-wide mdl-card mdl-shadow--2dp\\\">\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"mdl-card__title\\\">\\r\\n        <h2 class=\\\"mdl-card__title-text\\\">Why did I choose to use this complicated architecture?</h2>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"mdl-card__supporting-text\\\">\\r\\n        In today's world, there is no company that uses simple HTML and CSS to make their websites.

In reality, this website uses Angular 2, Material Design Lite, and Webpacks. Angular 2 is used to fetch all my information from JSON files and to display them without\\r\\n        refreshing the page. Webpacks is used to bundle my application and to make load times quicker. Lastly, Material Design Lite was used to make an eye-appealing UI.\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\\"demo-card-wide mdl-card mdl-shadow--2dp\\\">\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"mdl-card__title\\\">\\r\\n        <h2 class=\\\"mdl-card__title-text\\\">Why did I choose to use this complicated architecture?</h2>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n    <div class=\\\"mdl-card__supporting-text\\\">\\r\\n        In today's world, there is no company that uses simple HTML and CSS to make their websites.
